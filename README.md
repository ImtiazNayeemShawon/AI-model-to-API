## Integrating an AI Model with Node.js and Flask API

Imagine you are developing an AI model that can identify plants and animals from an image, providing the common name, scientific name, and additional information about the species. Meanwhile, your friend is building an app that allows zoo and botanical garden visitors to look up plant and animal information by searching a fixed database.

### Problem
Your friend’s application requires users to search manually, but with your AI model, users could simply snap a picture and get instant information without needing to type or search. To enhance the app experience, you want to integrate your AI model into this application.

### Solution: Using a Flask API with Node.js

To make this integration possible:
1. **Convert your AI model into a Flask API.**
2. **Expose a `/predict` endpoint** where the model accepts an image input.
3. **Connect your Node.js app** to this Flask API, enabling your friend’s application to retrieve plant or animal information automatically from an image.

Below is a simplified example using Flask and basic HTML/JS.

### Flask API Example

This is a basic setup for exposing your AI model via a Flask API. You can integrate it with any frontend or backend framework through HTTP requests.

**Live Example:** [senti.zipboxs.com](https://senti.zipboxs.com/)

**GitHub Repository:** [AI Model to API](https://github.com/ImtiazNayeemShawon/AI-model-to-API)

### How It Works

1. **Model Training and Prediction Endpoint**: Create a Flask server that includes a route, `/predict`, which will handle the image input and return the identified plant or animal details.
2. **Integration with JavaScript/Node.js**: Use Node.js to make HTTP requests to the Flask API, allowing your friend’s application to call the model and receive accurate results from just an image input.

> **Note**: This is a practice project with a limited dataset, so accuracy may vary.
